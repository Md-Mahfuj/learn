# What is V8?
### V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, or ARM processors. V8 can be embedded into any C++ application.

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of giving variables a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used through the entirety of your program.

Variables in JavaScript are containers which hold reusable data. In other words, they are units of storage, like some sort of box into which we can put data.

Here are the following three simple steps to creating a variable:

Create a variable with the appropriate name.
Store your value in it.
Retrieve and use the stored value from the variable.
